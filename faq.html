        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>Can my dentures be repaired?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Yes. Many breaks, cracks and loose teeth can be repaired professionally. We don’t recommend DIY repair kits or household glues, as they can damage the denture and affect the fit. If you can, keep all pieces and contact us for advice on the best next step.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>Do dentures need adjusting after fitting?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            It’s normal to need one or more follow-up appointments for minor adjustments. Your mouth adapts and small pressure points can appear. We’ll advise on what’s normal and help you get comfortable as quickly as possible.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>I’ve struggled with dentures before — can you still help?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Absolutely. Many patients come to us after previous discomfort or looseness. Simon can assess your facial profile, smile and speech, and work with you towards a fit and appearance that feels right.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>What happens at the first consultation?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            We’ll discuss your needs, concerns and preferences. Where appropriate, we’ll assess your mouth and talk through suitable options. You’ll have a chance to ask questions and understand what the next steps look like.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>How many appointments will I need?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            This depends on the type of denture and what’s needed. Some cases require multiple stages to achieve the best fit and appearance. We’ll explain the expected number of appointments after assessment.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>What’s the difference between NHS and private dentures?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            The main differences are usually the materials available, the time spent on aesthetics, and the number of stages/appointments. We’ll explain your options clearly so you can choose what suits your needs and budget.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>Why do dentures feel loose over time?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Over time, your gums and jawbone can change shape, which can affect how dentures fit. A reline, adjustment or replacement may be recommended depending on comfort, stability and wear.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>What is a denture reline?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            A reline reshapes the fitting surface of your denture so it sits more comfortably and securely against your gums. Relines can help if your dentures feel loose due to natural changes in the mouth.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>How long do dentures last?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Dentures typically need reviewing over time because your mouth changes. Some people may need a reline after a period of wear, and others may need replacement after several years. We’ll guide you based on fit, comfort and condition.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>Do you offer same-day dentures?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Yes, same-day options are available in certain cases. This depends on your needs and what is clinically appropriate. We’ll confirm suitability after your consultation.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>What’s the difference between same-day and fast-track dentures?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Same-day dentures are produced within a very short timeframe where suitable. Fast-track dentures allow a quicker turnaround than a traditional process while still keeping important stages for fit and appearance. We’ll advise what’s best for you based on comfort, stability and aesthetics.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>Can you add a tooth to an existing denture?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Often, yes. If you lose a tooth or need an addition, we can assess whether your denture can be modified safely and effectively.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>How should I clean my dentures?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Clean dentures daily with a denture-safe cleaner and a soft brush. Avoid boiling water, which can distort them. Rinse after meals where possible, and follow product instructions for soaking times.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>Do you offer denture cleaning?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Yes. Professional cleaning helps remove staining and build-up and can freshen the appearance of dentures. We’ll also advise on home care to keep them in good condition.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>Should I sleep with my dentures in?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            In most cases it’s best to remove dentures overnight to allow your gums to rest. We’ll advise what’s best for you based on your denture type and comfort.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>Can I use denture adhesive?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Some people find adhesive helpful, particularly while adjusting to new dentures. However, it shouldn’t be used to “fix” a poor fit. If your dentures feel loose, we recommend an assessment.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>Do you provide emergency dentures?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Yes, emergency appointments may be available depending on the issue and capacity. If you’re without dentures or have a break, contact us as soon as possible by email and include “URGENT” in the subject line.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>Do you offer implant-retained dentures?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Yes — for patients who already have dental implants placed (or are planning implant treatment with an implant clinician). We can discuss your options and work alongside your implant team where appropriate.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>What are sports mouthguards and who are they for?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Sports mouthguards help protect teeth and gums from impact during sports. If you take part in contact sports, a properly fitting mouthguard can reduce the risk of dental injury.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
