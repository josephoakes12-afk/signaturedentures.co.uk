          <summary><span>Can my dentures be repaired?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Yes. Many breaks, cracks and loose teeth can be repaired professionally. We don’t recommend DIY repair kits or household glues, as they can damage the denture and affect the fit. If you can, keep all pieces and contact us for advice on the best next step.

          <summary><span>Do dentures need adjusting after fitting?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            It’s normal to need one or more follow-up appointments for minor adjustments. Your mouth adapts and small pressure points can appear. We’ll advise on what’s normal and help you get comfortable as quickly as possible.

          <summary><span>How long do dentures last?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Dentures typically need reviewing over time because your gums and jaw can change. Some people may need a reline or replacement after a number of years. We’ll guide you based on fit, comfort and wear.

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>What’s the difference between NHS and private dentures?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            The main differences are usually the materials available, the time spent on aesthetics and the number of stages/appointments. We’ll explain options clearly so you can choose what suits your needs and budget.

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary><span>How should I clean my dentures?</span><span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></summary>
          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Clean dentures daily with a denture-safe cleaner and a soft brush. Avoid boiling water, which can distort them. We’ll also advise how to care for your gums and any remaining natural teeth.

          <div class="faq-panel small">
            Absolutely. Many people come to us after previous discomfort or looseness. Simon’s clinical training means he can assess your facial profile, smile and speech, and work with you towards a fit and appearance that feels right.
